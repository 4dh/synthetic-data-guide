# Guide to Synthetic Data Creation for Data Science Projects (with a medical domain focus)

## Introduction

Synthetic data provides realistic artificial data that mimics the statistical properties of real data without exposing sensitive information. This guide covers practical tools, repositories, and methodologies for creating and utilizing synthetic data, with special focus on medical domain applications.

## General Synthetic Data Generation Tools

### 1. [Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)](https://sdv.dev/)

A comprehensive Python ecosystem for generating synthetic tabular data developed at the MIT Data-to-AI Laboratory.

- **GitHub Repository**: [sdv-dev/SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV)
- **Documentation**: [docs.sdv.dev/sdv](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv)

**Key Features:**
- Handles single tables, relational data, and time series
- Multiple algorithms (GaussianCopula, CTGAN, etc.)
- Data quality evaluation and visualization
- Anonymization controls and constraints

**Example Usage:**
```python
from sdv.tabular import GaussianCopula

# Train model
model = GaussianCopula()
model.fit(real_data)

# Generate synthetic data
synthetic_data = model.sample(num_rows=1000)
```

### 2. [YData Synthetic](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic)

A Python package focused on generative AI models for synthetic data generation.

**Key Features:**
- Implements CTGAN for tabular data
- TimeGAN for time-series data
- User-friendly Streamlit interface
- GPU acceleration support

### 3. [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)

A Python library for generating fake data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers.

**Key Features:**
- Extensive providers for different data types
- Supports multiple locales/languages
- Consistent generation with seeds
- Easy integration with other tools

**Example Usage:**
```python
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()
print(fake.name())
print(fake.email())
print(fake.address())
```

### 4. [Gretel Synthetics](https://github.com/gretelai/gretel-synthetics)

An open-source tool from commercial vendor Gretel.ai for synthetic data generation.

**Key Features:**
- Privacy-preserving algorithms
- Natural language generation capabilities
- API access for integration into pipelines

### 5. Other Notable Tools

- [Synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity): Collection of methods including GANs and VAEs
- [nbsynthetic](https://github.com/nubank/nbsynthetic): Focused on small to medium datasets with mixed data types
- [TGAN](https://github.com/DAI-Lab/TGAN): Generative adversarial training for tabular data
- [Mimesis](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis): Similar to Faker but with more context-aware data types

## Best Practices for Synthetic Data Creation

### Validation Methods

- **Statistical comparison**: Compare distributions, correlations, and summary statistics
- **Clinical quality measures**: Validate against known clinical guidelines (for medical data)
- **Machine learning performance**: Train models on synthetic vs. real data
- **Expert review**: Have domain experts evaluate the plausibility

### Implementation Steps

1. Define your use case: Determine what kind of synthetic data you need
2. Select your tool: Choose based on your specific requirements
3. Generate initial data: Create a small test set
4. Validate: Compare against real data statistics if available
5. Refine parameters: Adjust generation settings based on validation
6. Scale up: Generate your full synthetic dataset
7. Document: Record all parameters and methods used
